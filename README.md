In web2py, model (defines database tables), view (renders views of data) and controller components make up the
application. One controller (default) and two views (index and order) are included in this repo. Clicking on a button 
on the index page results a call to the order function within the default controller. The output of the function is 
rendered into html/js by the order view and returned to the browser.
